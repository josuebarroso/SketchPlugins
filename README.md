#Sketch plugins


Some sketch plugins I am working on for practice.


###Color Tints and Shades
Based on [Alessandro's color plugins](https://github.com/alssndro/sandros-sketch-plugins). It creates tints and shades from a base color.


###Reset All Kernings
It resets to 0 all text layers's kerning in current page.


###Grid Toggler
It shows and hides any layer you've appended the string "grid 1", "grid 2", "grid 3"... You can change that string by whatever you want. Useful for showing / hiding different custom grids (based on layers). (I recommend you adding keyboard shortcuts in system preferences).
